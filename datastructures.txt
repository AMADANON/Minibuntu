Please note that this is a goal, not a description of the current state.

These are the datastructures to be used by this minibuntu system.

There are two main files; override and packagedb.
Both of these are GDBM files, stored in apt/. They can be listed with lister.pl.
Since GDBMs do not support nested keys, the first level values are encoded with Data::Dumper(), and can be decoded with eval().

packagedb=>{
	$packagename=>{
		$packageversion=>{
			# "Files", if it exists, will be complete.
			"Files" (optional)=>{
				$filename (starting with ./)=>{
					"Type"=>"d"irectory, "f"ile, "h"ardlink, "l"ink (symlink)
					"Permissions"=>numeric value of permissions, IN DECIMAL
					"Timestamp"=>numeric, unix timestamp
					"Uid"=>may be numeric or name
					"Guid"=>may be numeric or name
					"Target" (hardlink/symlink only)=>What the link points to.
					"Size"=>in bytes.
				}
			},
			$sourcelist_attribute=>$sourcelist_value
			"DataTarCompression"(optional)=>compression used for data.tar.* in deb file (e.g. "bzip2", "gzip")
		}
	}
}

override=>{
	$packagename=>{
		"Package" (optional)=>.deb package to get files from
		"FilesVersion" (if Package is set)=>Most recent version seen
		"Files" (optional)=>if not used, assume install all files from "Package" {
			$targetfilename (starting with ./)=>{
				# These all default to "Package"'s values, if they exist.
				# If they do not, then they are not optional.
				"Guid" (optional if Package)=>may be numeric or name,
				"Uid" (optional if Package)=>may be numeric or name,
				"Timestamp" (optional if Package)=>Numeric, unix timestamp
				"SourceFilename" (optional, requires Package)=>Where to get the file; default=$targetfilename
				"Permissions" (optional if Package)=>numeric, decimal
				"Contents" (if no sourcefilename)=>Complete contents of file.
				"Diff" (optional, only if sourcefilename)=>diff to apply to sourcefile.
				"Target"=>space seperated scalar containing one or more of "filesystem", "documentation". Default="filesystem".
			}
		}
	}
}

Changes in packagedb and/or override may not neccesarily be written back.

reverse dependencies are not stored, since they apply only to a specific collection of packages.
